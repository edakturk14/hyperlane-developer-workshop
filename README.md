# Developer Workshop: Hyperlane Warp Routes ðŸŒ‰

This guide explains how to create and deploy a **Warp Route** for the **FAI token** on **Base** with a synthetic token on **Optimism Mainnet**, using Hyperlane Warp Routes.

---

## Steps to Create and Deploy a Warp Route

### **1. Install the Hyperlane CLI**

To start, install the Hyperlane CLI using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @hyperlane/cli
```

Verify your installation by checking the version:

```bash
hyperlane --version
```

### **2. Set Your Private Key (HYPE_KEY)**

Export your private key as an environment variable. This is required for contract deployments:

```bash
export HYPE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

### **3. Initialize the Warp Route**

Run the following command to set up the warp route:

```bash
hyperlane warp init
```

During Initialization:

1. Select Chains to Connect:

   - Source Chain (Token Origin): Base
   - Destination Chain: Optimism Mainnet

2. Choose Warp Route Type:

   - Collateral on Base (FAI token)
   - Synthetic on Optimism Mainnet (HypERC20 token)

3. Enter Token Details:
   - Source Token Address (FAI on Base): 0xb33Ff54b9F7242EF1593d2C9Bcd8f9df46c77935
   - Destination Token: The synthetic HypERC20 token, which will be created on Optimism Mainnet.

```bash
âœ… Successfully created new warp route deployment config.
```

##### Understanding Synthetic Tokens

Synthetic tokens are created on the destination chain to represent the original token. In this case:

- Original Token: FAI on Base (0xb33Ff54b9F7242EF1593d2C9Bcd8f9df46c77935)
- Synthetic Token: HypERC20 on Optimism Mainnet, deployed as part of the warp route.

Synthetic tokens are implemented in the HypERC20.sol contract and inherit standard ERC20 functionality.

### **4. Deploy the Warp Route Contracts**

Deploy the warp route with the following command:

```bash
hyperlane warp deploy
```

During deployment gas usage and statistics will be displayed. Deployment outputs will include the final configuration.

### **5. Interact with the Hyperlane UI & Verify the Warp Route**

Once the contracts are deployed, you can manage and test the warp route through the Hyperlane UI.

You can also use the SuperBridge Sandbox that will allow you to test the warp route.
